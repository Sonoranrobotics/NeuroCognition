# 🧠 Neurocognition – Modular iOS Tools for Cognitive Screening

**Neurocognition** is a suite of iOS apps built using Swift and SwiftUI that assess cognitive and neurological function using the iPhone camera and on-device AI. Each module is focused on a single task, such as facial symmetry detection, fall risk analysis, or motor response timing.

This repository will contain standalone apps, each designed to assess a specific neurological marker — beginning with eyebrow tracking for facial asymmetry evaluation.

## 📦 Modules

| Module | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Eyebrow Tracker** | Prompts user to raise eyebrows; uses Vision framework to detect symmetry or asymmetry | ✅ Completed |
| Smile Tracker | Detects left/right smile asymmetry and motor response delay | ⏳ In progress |
| Eye Tracking | Monitors saccades and gaze focus during prompts | 🔜 Planned |
| Fall Detection | Detects sudden vertical posture loss using rear camera | ✅ [See Fall Detection Repo](https://github.com/sonoranrobotics/fall-detection-app) |

## 📱 Eyebrow Tracker App

The **Eyebrow Tracker** module prompts the user to raise their eyebrows and uses Apple’s **Vision Framework** to detect motion in the left and right eyebrows relative to the eyes.

### Features:
- On-device face landmark detection (VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest)
- Calculates vertical eyebrow-eye distance delta
- Displays: “Left raised”, “Right raised”, “Both even”, or “No movement”
- Runs offline with no cloud dependency

### Demo:

## 🧠 Clinical Relevance

Neurocognition tools are inspired by clinical needs in neurology, geriatrics, and emergency care — especially for rapid stroke screening, early detection of cognitive decline, and fall risk. This project evolved from real-world work with physicians at **Mayo Clinic** and continues through **Sonoran Robotics LLC** in partnership with the **University of Arizona Center for Innovation**.
